Scrum
- Implemented backend functionality for having multiple users with multiple playlists
- New UI layout
- FB Integration in UI
- Bind FB session to local session

Right now I'm having a very strange problem; Rails is changing the Cookie
between requests, so it's losing track of the active session because
sessions are Cookie-based. 
For example, I call GET /playlist to bring a playlist, and then I call
POST /playlist to add a video to that playlist, but when the server gets
that request it doesn't find the current session because the Cookie changed.
I'm deploying the changes to UI layout but all backend functionality is broken
because of the problem above.
I've been struggling with this problem for 3 hours now.
